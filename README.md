# jamais-vu

Looping audio devices are a great place to reinvent the wheel. This is a looper that doesn't have to loop, like a wheel that doesn't have to turn. It's more like a memory with very imperfect recall. Things come back in tiny fragments, drenched in noise, or not at all. Often they didn't happen in the first place, or did they?

Jamais-vu can be controlled through an api for live coding, a gui optimized for hi-dpi touchscreen, or osc messages.

This is still a barely-functioning work-in-progress proto-prototype.
